                <p>
                    You’ve spent hours combing the internet to find that perfect look. You head off to your local salon
                    and show
                    the stylist the fruits of your online labor. They nod approvingly and lead you back to the chair …
                    only to
                    send you away looking worse than your 6 year old daughter’s least favorite barbie doll after it’s
                    last “spa
                    day”… Sound familiar? With HairCare, you can login and see a list of stylists in your area,
                    easily view photos of styles they have done for other customers, upload a photo of your haircut and
                    rate a
                    stylists performance for other users to see.
                    Like keeping tabs on what your competion is up to? HairCare has got you covered. With HairCare,
                    you’ll never
                    leave the salon feeling unsatisfied again.
